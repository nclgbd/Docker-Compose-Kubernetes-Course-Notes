| **What is Docker?**                       | Docker is a containerization software that allows for a piece of software to run. It will have all necessary requirements to run in that containerized environment and can also communicate with other containers<br><br>It is analogous to a picnic basket: everything you need for the picnic will be inside the basket                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Why use Docker and containers?**        | **Different development and production environments** - we want to build and test in exactly the same environment as we later run in the app. This ensures that it works exactly as tested<br>**Different development environments within a company/team** - every team member should have the exact same environment working on the same project. It should be easy to share a common development environment/setup with new employees and colleagues<br>**Clashing tools/versions between different projects** - When switching between projects, tools used in project A should not clash with tools using in project B. We don't want to uninstall and re-install local dependencies and runtimes all the time                                                                   |
| **Why not use Virtual Machines instead?** | On it's face, it seems VMs solves all of the issues mentioned in the above row, as they are isolated environments that sit on top of your OS and simply share the resources. There are several drawbacks though:<br>**1.** A lot of wasted space as each VM needs to replicate many resources that either won't be used or are the exact same<br>**2.** Performance can still be slow as it's running an entire OS in addition to the packaged software<br>**3.** You still have the issue of reproducing everything on another server. It is possible, but requires a lot of overhead<br><br>Docker containers in contrast have low impact on the OS, supports sharing and rebuilding to make sharing environments easy, and only encapsulates the application and its environment. |
