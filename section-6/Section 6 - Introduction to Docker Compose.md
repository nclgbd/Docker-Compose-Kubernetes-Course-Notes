| What is docker compose? Why is it useful?                              | Docker compose is a way to orchestrate the building and deployment of multiple docker containers and images, although you can also deploy a single application. It's useful as you don't have to memorize long commands to build and run containers, but rather by configuring a YAML file |
| What are the two most common docker compose commands? What do they do? | - `docker-compose up -d` will start all of the services as defined in a `docker-compose.yaml` file<br>- `docker-compose down` will stop the services as defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file                                                                                          |
| Give an example of the components of a `docker-compose.yaml` file      | See [this file](docker-compose.yaml).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Does the `docker-compose` command replace the `docker` command?        | No, both commands work together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Which problem does `docker-compose` mainly solve?                      | Annoying repetition of (long) commands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
